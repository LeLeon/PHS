Version 0.6.1

TRP-Hire used to be KSI-Hiring.
TRP stands for TheReadPanda, the ID I use on twitch, twitter, youtube and the web at thereadpanda.com 

The mod currently is in beta. It does not include the Mini-AVC or AVC calls.

It is not up on CKAN yet and will not be until I get it out of 'beta'. But it should work. If you have issues please notify me.

You can submit issues to the PHS directory for Https://github.com/TheReadPanda/PHS
PHS stands for Panda Hiring Services.

Thank you for using my mod! 

Simply put the TRP-Hire folder and all the contents of it (Hire.dll, readme.txt and TRP-License.txt) into your gamedata folder for KSP. Then run KSP. If you enter the astronaut complex you should see the updated/modified UI.

Happy Kerbaling!
